Category Product Project
1] Creating a Spring Boot Project
To create a Spring Boot project, follow these steps:
•	- Using Spring Initializr
  - Project: Maven Project
  - Language: Java
  - Spring Boot Version: 2.x.x or the latest version
  - Group: com.project
  - Artifact: CatProduct
 - Dependencies:
    • Spring Web
    • Spring Data JPA
    • Spring Boot DevTools
    • Spring Data JDBC
After selecting these configurations, generate and download the ZIP file of the project.
2] Application Properties
Configure the `application.properties` file to set up the database connection:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/category_product
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=******
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
This property controls Hibernate’s schema generation, updating, or validation at runtime.
3] Checking Dependencies
After generating the project, verify that all required dependencies are correctly added to `pom.xml`. If any dependency is missing, manually add it.
4] Code Setup
Entities:
- **Category**: Contains category details and a list of products.
  - `@OneToMany` to establish a one-to-many relationship with the Product entity.
- **Product**: Contains product details and a reference to a category.
  - `@ManyToOne` to associate with a Category.
Repositories:
- **CategoryRepository**: Extends JpaRepository for basic CRUD operations.
  - Has a method to find categories by name and paginate results.
- **ProductRepository**: Extends JpaRepository for basic CRUD operations.
  - Contains custom query methods like deleting products by category ID.
Controllers:
- **CategoryController**: Contains functions to display all categories, delete, update, show one category, and pagination.
- **ProductController**: Contains similar methods for product management.
- `@RestController`: Used to build RESTful web services (combines `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody`).
5] Postman - API Testing Tool
Postman is an API testing tool that allows developers to send HTTP requests, inspect responses, and automate RESTful API testing.
**Key Features:**
•	✔ User-friendly interface
•	✔ Easy API requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
•	✔ Automated API Testing
•	✔ Saves time (avoids using curl commands or browser-based testing)
•	✔ Auto-generates API documentation
